## 📊 Tata Data Visualisation: Empowering Business with Effective Insights  

This repository contains my work from the **Tata Data Visualisation Virtual Experience Programme**, where I acted as a data consultant for an online retail store. My objective was to analyze the store's data, generate valuable insights, and present findings to the **CEO and CMO** for strategic decision-making.  

## 🏢 Business Context  

The online retail store has been performing well, and senior management wants to understand:  
- What factors contribute to revenue growth?  
- How different categories perform?  
- What opportunities exist for future expansion?  

To answer these questions, I drafted a set of four key questions tailored to the perspectives of both the CEO and CMO, ensuring a data-driven approach to decision-making.  

## 🔍 Data Cleaning & Preparation  

Before analysis, I cleaned the dataset to ensure accuracy:  
✔ **Removed errors** (e.g., negative quantities and incorrect unit prices)  
✔ **Applied conditional checks** (quantity ≥ 1, unit price ≥ $0)  
✔ **Used data transformation techniques** to filter out incorrect data  

## 📈 Data Analysis & Visualisation  

I used **Tableau** to create interactive dashboards and visual reports. Each visual was designed based on the CEO and CMO’s requirements and was presented on separate sheets in Tableau.  

**Key analysis areas included:**  
- Revenue trends and contributing factors  
- Sales breakdown by categories  
- Insights for business growth strategies  
- Identifying key strengths and opportunities  

## 🖥️ Final Presentation  

After completing the analysis, I presented my findings to the **CEO and CMO** using a PowerPoint presentation, providing insights that support strategic planning and revenue optimization.
